# Aphrodite-React

A demo application using React and Aphrodite.

## Installation

```sh
git clone git@github.com:jkup/aphrodite-react.git
cd aphrodite-react
npm install
npm start
```

## Styles

As a proof of concept, the `src/styles` folder contains a Buttons.js file which exports an Aphrodite StyleSheet. This could be an approach used to share styles without passing them through the entire app as props.
